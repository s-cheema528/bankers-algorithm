Banker's Algorithm Simulation Algorithm - This project simulates the Banker's Algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It is implemented using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

Features
- Input for available resources and process details.
- Dynamic addition of processes.
- Step-by-step execution of the algorithm.
- Visualization of the safe sequence.

Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- ttk (for themed widgets)

How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Run the script:
   python bankers_algorithm.py

- Follow the on-screen instructions to input data and run the algorithm.
